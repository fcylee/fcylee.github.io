    <p>Proteins and RNAs together organise cellular compartments.</p> 
    <p>Neurons have specialised morphologies. Together with collaborators, we wish to establish a systems-level understanding of where mRNAs are in relationship to each other in neurons and their protein interactors to understand how molecular neighbourhoods of localised mRNAs contribute to the development and maintenance of local compartments as well as the coordination of molecular events in homo- or heterotypic RNA granules.</p>
