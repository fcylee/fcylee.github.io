<p>Neuronal function is dependent on its specialized morphologies and spatiotemporal regulation of compartmentalisation. Our goal is to develop a systems-level understanding of where mRNAs are positioned relative to one another in neurons, along with their protein interactors. By mapping these molecular neighborhoods, we aim to uncover how localized mRNAs contribute to the formation and maintenance of neuronal subcellular compartments and how molecular events are coordinated within RNA granules.</p>
