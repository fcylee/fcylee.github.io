<p>Local protein synthesis and RNA transport have emerged as key players in synaptic maintenance and plasticity, and these processes are dysregulated in NDDs.</p>
<p>My overarching hypothesis is that regulation of synaptic mRNA localisation and translation may be disrupted in some NDDs due to aberrant 3â€™UTR isoform expression, RNA structure and RBP binding. We are currently investigating this hypothesis by identifying these mRNA signatures in two NDD risk gene mouse models with opposing functional synaptic phenotypes.</p>
