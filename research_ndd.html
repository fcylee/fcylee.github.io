    <p>Local protein synthesis and RNA transport have emerged as key players in synaptic maintenance and plasticity. These can be disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs); a classic example is in Fragile-X syndrome and the importance of FMRP for translation repression. </p>
    <p>However, it is unclear whether disturbed RNA metabolism at the synapse play a role for NDDs in general.</p>
    <p>My overarching hypothesis is that regulation of synaptic mRNA localisation and translation may be disrupted in some NDDs due to aberrant 3â€™UTR isoform expression, RNA structure and RBP binding. We are currently investigating this hypothesis by identifying these mRNA signatures in two NDD risk gene mouse models with opposing functional synaptic phenotypes.</p>
