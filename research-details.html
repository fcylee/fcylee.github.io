        <h3>Molecular neighbourhoods of localised mRNAs and their regulatory code</h3>
        <p>Neuronal function is dependent on its specialized morphologies and spatiotemporal regulation of compartmentalisation. Our goal is to develop a systems-level understanding of where mRNAs are positioned relative to one another in neurons, along with their protein interactors. By mapping these molecular neighborhoods, we aim to uncover how localized mRNAs contribute to the formation and maintenance of neuronal subcellular compartments and how molecular events are coordinated within RNA granules.</p>

        <h3>Synaptic mRNA signatures in neurodevelopmental disorder risk gene models</h3>
        <p>Local protein synthesis and RNA transport have emerged as key players in synaptic maintenance and plasticity, and these processes are dysregulated in NDDs.</p>
        <p>My overarching hypothesis is that regulation of synaptic mRNA localisation and translation may be disrupted in some NDDs due to aberrant 3'UTR isoform expression, RNA structure and RBP binding. We are currently investigating this hypothesis by identifying these mRNA signatures in two NDD risk gene mouse models with opposing functional synaptic phenotypes.</p>

        <h3>Methodologies for studying mRNP assembly principles</h3>
        <p>Post-transcriptional regulation depends on the spatiotemporal assembly of RBPs on a given transcript (i.e. RNP assembly). This is dependent on both RNA sequence and structural contexts, relative protein/RNA abundance levels as well as potential for co-condensation of multiple protein and RNA molecules to form larger 'granule'-like assemblies. Understanding the principles for RNP assembly should guide predictions of functional gene expression regulation upon mutations or other perturbations.</p>
        <p>Together with collaborators, we have streamlined iCLIP- and proximity ligation- based methodologies to pinpoint where specific proteins bind on RNA and to analyse the pattern of their sequence and structural contexts. We also developed ways to monitor the global-protein occupancy landscape on RNAs, which may prioritise and identify important regulatory elements of RNP assembly.</p>
        <p>With these methodologies we are uncovering the ensemble of conformations occupied by RNA molecules throughout its life cycle and how this changes with different (neuronal) cell states.</p>
