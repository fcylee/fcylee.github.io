<p>Post-transcriptional regulation depends on the spatiotemporal assembly of RBPs on a given transcript (i.e. RNP assembly). This is dependent on both RNA sequence and structural contexts, relative protein/RNA abundance levels as well as potential for co-condensation of multiple protein and RNA molecules to form larger ‘granule’-like assemblies. Understanding the principles for RNP assembly should guide predictions of functional gene expression regulation upon mutations or other perturbations.</p>
<p>Together with collaborators, we have streamlined iCLIP- and proximity ligation- based methodologies to pinpoint where specific proteins bind on RNA and to analyse the pattern of their sequence and structural contexts. We also developed ways to monitor the global-protein occupancy landscape on RNAs, which may prioritise and identify important regulatory elements of RNP assembly. </p>
<p>With these methodologies we are uncovering the ensemble of conformations occupied by RNA molecules throughout its life cycle and how this changes with different (neuronal) cell states. </p>
